# Beezig Laby Mirror
This converts the [BeezigLaby](https://github.com/Beezig/BeezigLaby) repository to a version that's suitable for LabyMod's automated build system.

## Notes to LabyMod admins
### Mirror nature
The way this mirror works is by unzipping the compiled jar into the resources directory.

The changeset for each version is available in the [parent repository](https://github.com/Beezig/BeezigLaby).
